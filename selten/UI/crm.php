            <p class="crm-para">CRM systems compile data from a range of different communication channels, including a company's website, telephone, email, live chat, marketing materials and more recently, social media.[2] They allow businesses to learn more about their target audiences and how to best cater for their needs, thus retaining customers and driving sales growth.[3] CRM may be used with past, present or potential customers. The concepts, procedures, and rules that a corporation follows when communicating with its consumers are referred to as CRM. This complete connection covers direct contact with customers, such as sales and service-related operations, forecasting, and the analysis of consumer patterns and behaviors, from the perspective of the company.[4] According to Gartner, the global CRM market size is estimated at $69 billion in 2020.[5][6]</p>
